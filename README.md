ginger
======

ginger is a simple type safe i18n library for Java. Inspired by ideas from [GWT intenalization features](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideI18n).

**It is currently in development with version 0.2.1.**

Features
--------
- Type safety. Inspired by GWT messages and constants
- Supports standard Java properties with UTF-8 encoding
- Pluralization support for about 150 languages 
- Servlet and JSP support
- Easy Spring integration
- [Joda Time](joda-time.sourceforge.net) support in message format
- Extensibility. Any file format can be used for loading localization resources from any location
- Easy to use, fast and thread-safe
- [Commons Lang 3](http://commons.apache.org/lang/)  is the only single dependency.


FAQ
---
### My application does not require localization, should I use it?
Even if you are not using localization aspect of ginger you can still benefit from it.
- Externalizing strings and messages is a good practice for any application.
- It can be used as an application wide holder for formatters: dates, numbers and so on. In contrast to regular formatters it motivates to localize them in single place + it solves JDK formatters thread-safety issues.
- See [other features](#Features)

### I don't want to use Joda Time. Do I need to have it as a dependency?
No, you don't have to. ginger automatically enables Joda Time support only when it sees it in classpath.

### Is pluralization for language X supported?
Yes, if it is in [this list](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html).

### Pluralization for language X is not supported. How can I add it?
Submit issue for your language with plural rules provided. See examples [here](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html).

Roadmap
--------
- Make error handling and defaults more configurable
